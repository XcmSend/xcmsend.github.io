# $DED memecoin - Rococo testnet   


**Rococo ROC to Rococo Assethub transfers**!
A fun new meme token is being launched in the Polkadot ecosystem. Since we both want to release a fun christmas feature and support $DED, we made a fun animation.

XCM on Rococo can be unstable is and we are not affiliated with the $DED token. This is a tech demo to show Rococo testnet XCM transfers.
