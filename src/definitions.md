# Definitions and terminology


# Teleport   
Similar, but not the same as the dotsama ecosystem definition of Teleport, we define the `Teleport` action as any type of cross chain transfer that goes from one chain to another.  


Teleport = Cross chain transfer 


# Swap   


Swap = Selling on asset for another on a decentralized exchange.  

Note: we currently only support HydraDx to HydraDx swaps at the moment.  

# Action Node   
You can drag in an action node between two chains, the action is either Teleport or Swap.

# Chain Node   
A chain node defines the source and destination chain. Drag in a chain box and select which chain you want to add in your workflow.  

# Scenario  
Every workspace/transaction flow is refeered to as a scenario. You can browse the current scenarios you have created in xcmsend  by going to **/labs**
