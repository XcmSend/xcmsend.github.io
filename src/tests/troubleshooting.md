```
Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached, watch ''
at FSWatcher. (node:internal/fs/watchers:244:19)
at Object.watch (node:fs:2264:34)

This means that you need to increase your linux file watcher limit size. Do this by increasing the number in the file: `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches`.
