# Polkadot cross chain xtransfer

If you want to send cross chain transfers from or to polkadot you can do so we XCMSend.

**Note**:  
Polkadot does not implement the same architecture for storing assets such as assethub or other parachains. Limiting the functionality to only being able to send the native currency(DOT) to other chains with a xtransfer action.
